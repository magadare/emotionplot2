       " is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\n",
       " name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\n",
       " not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\n",
       " that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\n",
       " balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\n",
       " machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\n",
       " a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\n",
       " sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\n",
       " the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\n",
       " admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\n",
       " to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\n",
       " results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\n",
       " high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\n",
       " nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\n",
       " the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\n",
       " other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\n",
       " around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\n",
       " sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\n",
       " society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\n",
       " buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\n",
       " and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
       " nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\n",
       " occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\n",
       " following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\n",
       " abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\n",
       " vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\n",
       " Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\n",
       " brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\n",
       " so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\n",
       " signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
       " the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning\n",
       " from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\n",
       " way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\n",
       " must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\n",
       " incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\n",
       " Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\n",
       " rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\n",
       " figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\n",
       " room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\n",
       " behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\n",
       " told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\n",
       " drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\n",
       " bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",

       " shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\n",
       " brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway\n",
       " up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\n",
       " completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\n",
       " appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across\n",
       " the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
       " mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\n",
       " raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a\n",

       " peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\n",
       " equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\n",

       " front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was\n",
       " just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\n",
       " description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\n",
       " the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\n",
       " animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a\n",
       " corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\n",

       " “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\n",
       " house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a\n",
       " double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its\n",
       " being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of\n",

       " size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
       " that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of\n",
       " the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry\n",
       " it about with her.”\n",

       " inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\n",
       " their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could\n",
       " trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\n",
       " influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that\n",
       " she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\n",

       " As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of\n",

       " open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another\n",
       " loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,\n",
       " which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\n",
       " loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.\n",
       " A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her\n",

       " the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and\n",
       " dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall\n",
       " the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the\n",
       " other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle\n",
       " without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the\n",
       " injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps;\n",

       " through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in\n",

       " from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes\n",

       " it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and\n",
       " also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an\n",
       " unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady\n",

       " the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it\n",
       " as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\n",
       " replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\n",
       " her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated\n",
       " whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come\n",
       " in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little\n",

       " where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard\n",

       " itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\n",
       " thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\n",
       " occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme\n",

       " formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid\n",
       " his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of\n",

       " <i>Encyclopædia</i>, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the\n",
       " way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\n",
       " really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt\n",
       " suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his\n",
       " accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and\n",

       " elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\n",
       " be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the\n",
       " assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\n",
       " cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\n",
       " inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one\n",

       " habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them\n",
       " at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the\n",

       " When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\n",
       " the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\n",

       " “The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\n",
       " money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\n",
       " daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\n",
       " in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\n",
       " was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\n",
       " disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\n",
       " evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\n",
       " would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\n",
       " course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\n",
       " it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\n",
       " seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\n",
       " not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\n",
       " announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\n",
       " clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\n",
       " than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\n",
       " himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\n",
       " moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\n",
       " insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\n",

       " carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\n",
       " France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\n",
       " was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\n",
       " by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\n",
       " for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",
       " real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\n",
       " would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\n",
       " else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\n",
       " to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\n",
       " business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\n",
       " impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\n",
       " any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\n",
       " upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\n",
       " happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\n",
       " Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\n",
       " that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\n",
       " As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\n",
       " he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\n",
       " four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if\n",
       " you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\n",
       " are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the\n",
       " first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an\n",

       " </p>\n",

       " punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a\n",
       " whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the\n",
       " sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of\n",
       " my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I\n",
       " shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,\n",
       " but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\n",
       " the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James\n",

       " that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see,\n",
       " was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\n",
       " that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\n",
       " the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\n",
       " as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\n",
       " action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\n",

       " absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\n",
       " the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his\n",
       " screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What\n",
       " could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my\n",
       " medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\n",
       " which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\n",
       " deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\n",
       " the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a\n",
       " blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\n",

       " could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\n",
       " delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his\n",
       " fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible\n",

       " that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\n",
       " presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\n",

       " by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\n",
       " and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\n",
       " grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\n",
       " my companion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
       " twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\n",
       " the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\n",
       " came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\n",
       " with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\n",
       " feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\n",
       " feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\n",
       " better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\n",
       " are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\n",
       " so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\n",
       " out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\n",
       " father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\n",
       " butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\n",
       " here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
       " they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\n",
       " from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\n",
       " until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\n",
       " beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\n",
       " farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\n",
       " satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\n",
       " dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\n",
       " examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\n",
       " far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\n",
       " he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\n",
       " until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\n",
       " returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\n",
       " right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\n",
       " and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",
       " luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\n",

       " however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not\n",
       " offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so\n",
       " high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\n",
       " too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings\n",
       " without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have\n",
       " their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that\n",
       " absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of\n",

       " may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\n",
       " watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore\n",
       " the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of\n",
       " the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at\n",
       " some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the\n",

       " at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw\n",

       " of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where\n",
       " he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\n",
       " plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he\n",
       " came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had\n",
       " made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them\n",
       " was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in\n",
       " extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\n",
       " quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\n",
       " disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he\n",
       " set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house,\n",
       " and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\n",
       " would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\n",

       " year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\n",
       " father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he\n",
       " was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he\n",
       " would make me his representative both with the servants and with the\n",

       " invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\n",

       " upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips\n",
       " at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\n",
       " skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in\n",
       " his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My\n",

       " ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have\n",
       " belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in\n",
       " the other.\n",

       " <p>\n",

       " empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the\n",

       " revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he\n",
       " was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot\n",
       " fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and\n",
       " bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the\n",

       " dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive\n",
       " ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin,\n",
       " and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\n",
       " teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew\n",

       " point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an\n",
       " amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\n",
       " actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\n",
       " famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments.\n",
       " I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good\n",
       " scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of\n",
       " flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress,\n",
       " I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a\n",
       " match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when\n",

       " coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not\n",
       " ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on\n",
       " my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a\n",
       " disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room,\n",
       " and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my\n",
       " violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that\n",
       " morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had\n",
       " just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I\n",
       " hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other\n",
       " clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables\n",
       " up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief,\n",
       " that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as\n",
       " his murderer.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\n",
       " determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference\n",
       " for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off\n",
       " my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was\n",
       " watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause\n",

       " right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at\n",

       " very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\n",
       " in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\n",

       " miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\n",

       " returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down\n",
       " Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,\n",
       " walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his\n",
       " shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between\n",
       " this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\n",
       " man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging\n",
       " it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed\n",

       " having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform\n",
       " rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid\n",
       " the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.\n",
       " The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in\n",
       " possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the\n",
       " shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n",

       " B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some\n",
       " thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it\n",

       " for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.\n",
       " There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials\n",
       " “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\n",
       " a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\n",
       " exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was\n",
       " characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have\n",
       " been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are\n",
       " very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\n",
       " probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\n",
       " face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years,\n",
       " although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now\n",
       " than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the\n",
       " decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\n",

       " sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\n",
       " has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he\n",
       " anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be\n",
       " deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he\n",

       " intellectual?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in\n",
       " then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and\n",
       " the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three\n",
       " years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the\n",
       " world.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\n",
       " the moral retrogression?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting\n",
       " his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\n",
       " never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\n",
       " of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the\n",
       " wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to\n",
       " replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which\n",
       " is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has\n",
       " endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with\n",
       " ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\n",
       " that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be\n",
       " gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens\n",
       " discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.\n",
       " They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\n",
       " This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the\n",
       " fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most\n",

       " west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute\n",
       " and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a\n",
       " gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of\n",
       " ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a\n",

       " Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\n",
       " established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some\n",
       " robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to\n",
       " death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\n",

       " we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be\n",

       " I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\n",
       " to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\n",
       " “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\n",
       " definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\n",

       " shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott\n",
       " has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before\n",
       " evening.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s\n",
       " acquaintance,” said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\n",
       " occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\n",
       " cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\n",
       " to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\n",
       " Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once\n",
       " to the rooms which we are to examine.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion\n",
       " and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\n",
       " one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,\n",
       " while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was\n",
       " in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and\n",
       " the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys,\n",
       " showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been\n",
       " erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\n",
       " there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\n",
       " slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\n",
       " outsides of the windows.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\n",

       " Roylott’s chamber?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\n",
       " seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\n",
       " room.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs\n",
       " the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of\n",
       " course?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\n",
       " from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar\n",
       " your shutters?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open\n",
       " window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without\n",
       " success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the\n",
       " bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron,\n",
       " built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching\n",
       " his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some\n",
       " difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we\n",
       " shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\n",
       " bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at\n",
       " once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which\n",
       " her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low\n",
       " ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\n",
       " brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in\n",
       " another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These\n",
       " articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\n",
       " room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the\n",
       " panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured\n",
       " that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one\n",
       " of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and\n",
       " round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing\n",
       " to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\n",
       " upon the pillow.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It looks newer than the other things?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted\n",
       " for ourselves.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will\n",
       " excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He\n",
       " threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly\n",
       " backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he\n",
       " did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\n",
       " walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his\n",
       " eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it\n",
       " a brisk tug.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Won’t it ring?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can\n",
       " see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for\n",
       " the ventilator is.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There\n",
       " are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\n",
       " builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\n",
       " trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\n",
       " time.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\n",
       " bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss\n",
       " Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,\n",

       " mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden\n",
       " chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\n",
       " things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all\n",
       " of them with the keenest interest.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n",

       " “Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer\n",

       " could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and\n",

       " suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to\n",
       " which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of\n",
       " pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that\n",
       " away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised\n",
       " the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles\n",
       " protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\n",
       " Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed\n",
       " during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a\n",
       " dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a\n",
       " peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\n",
       " round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n",

       " puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in\n",

       " recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for\n",
       " another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove\n",

       " happened.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\n",
       " throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\n",
       " perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\n",

       " Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\n",
       " It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to\n",
       " too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl,\n",
       " how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at\n",
       " Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that\n",
       " the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The\n",
       " little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion\n",
       " which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\n",
       " insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n",
       " ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\n",
       " appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,\n",
       " were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the\n",
       " merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear\n",
       " to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come\n",
       " either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\n",
       " already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\n",
       " down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\n",
       " clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\n",
       " there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\n",
       " The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my\n",
       " knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India,\n",
       " I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\n",
       " poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just\n",
       " such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern\n",
       " training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also,\n",
       " from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\n",
       " indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show\n",
       " where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\n",
       " course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the\n",
       " victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to\n",
       " return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the\n",
       " hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope\n",
       " and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might\n",
       " escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\n",
       " inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on\n",
       " it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\n",
       " ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord\n",
       " were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\n",
       " clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily\n",
       " closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my\n",
       " mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.\n",
       " I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly\n",
       " lit the light and attacked it.”\n",

       " Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\n",
       " that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been\n",
       " nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more\n",
       " than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great\n",
       " intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the\n",
       " world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows\n",
       " to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I\n",
       " could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\n",
       " and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the\n",
       " colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At\n",
       " last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness\n",
       " of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark\n",
       " sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which\n",
       " gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and\n",
       " into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front\n",
       " of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\n",
       " heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\n",
       " drove away.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\n",
       " looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\n",
       " the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\n",
       " direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\n",
       " she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could\n",
       " see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her\n",
       " dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a\n",
       " foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion\n",
       " answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\n",
       " fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her\n",
       " ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\n",
       " walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for\n",
       " a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet,\n",
       " little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\n",
       " several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the\n",
       " top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an\n",
       " instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\n",
       " German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being\n",
       " volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might\n",
       " catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was\n",
       " folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock\n",
       " ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\n",
       " still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these\n",
       " German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\n",
       " place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all\n",
       " I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\n",
       " Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place\n",
       " might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the\n",
       " absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\n",

       " aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\n",
       " beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was\n",
       " sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\n",
       " shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of\n",

       " made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\n",

       " twelve miles over heavy roads?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet\n",

       " gang.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large\n",

       " of silver.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said\n",
       " the inspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.\n",
       " We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\n",
       " covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\n",
       " now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\n",
       " enough.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\n",
       " into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\n",
       " column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the\n",
       " neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “When did it break out?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the\n",
       " whole place is in a blaze.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Whose house is it?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Dr. Becher’s.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German,\n",
       " very thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\n",
       " Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\n",
       " waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand,\n",
       " who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do\n",
       " him no harm.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in\n",
       " the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\n",
       " widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink\n",
       " and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly\n",
       " striving to keep the flames under.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\n",
       " “There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.\n",
       " That second window is the one that I jumped from.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge\n",
       " upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it\n",
       " was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\n",
       " were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\n",
       " your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much\n",
       " fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\n",
       " has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the\n",
       " morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing\n",
       " several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of\n",
       " Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even\n",
       " Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\n",
       " whereabouts.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had\n",
       " found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon\n",
       " a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at\n",
       " last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had\n",
       " fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\n",
       " some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery\n",
       " which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel\n",
       " and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be\n",
       " found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\n",
       " been already referred to.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where\n",
       " he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for\n",
       " the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried\n",
       " down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\n",
       " unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent\n",
       " Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted\n",
       " the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\n",
       " once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost\n",
       " my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of\n",

       " claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of\n",
       " that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became\n",
       " absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover\n",

       " story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s\n",
       " son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still\n",
       " I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some\n",
       " grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.\n",
       " He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with\n",
       " his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\n",
       " thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\n",
       " hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat\n",
       " with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk\n",
       " brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little\n",
       " from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down\n",
       " in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side\n",
       " was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat\n",
       " hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\n",
       " tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,\n",
       " and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little\n",
       " used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all\n",
       " round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so\n",
       " round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder\n",
       " and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.\n",
       " We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\n",
       " She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which\n",
       " seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that\n",
       " I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too,\n",
       " were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently\n",
       " into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker\n",
       " had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\n",
       " evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for\n",
       " self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\n",
       " passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\n",
       " dad?” she asked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " </p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\n",
       " him.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word\n",
       " for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so\n",
       " dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary!\n",
       " Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\n",
       " from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to\n",
       " inquire more deeply into it.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he\n",

       " look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\n",
       " upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and\n",
       " the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the\n",

       " slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of\n",
       " this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\n",
       " light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in\n",
       " her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\n",
       " and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed\n",
       " in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the\n",
       " coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to\n",
       " her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n",

       " all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his\n",
       " bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\n",
       " where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to\n",
       " get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your\n",
       " lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the\n",
       " scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\n",
       " suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands,\n",
       " rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed\n",
       " that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to\n",
       " straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n",

       " that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state\n",
       " of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\n",

       " “When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once\n",
       " went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\n",
       " which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\n",
       " also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along\n",
       " the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\n",
       " indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\n",
       " door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one\n",
       " side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\n",
       " disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the\n",
       " deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then\n",
       " had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her\n",
       " sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\n",
       " I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\n",
       " which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long\n",
       " and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\n",
       " line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once\n",
       " convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had\n",
       " walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\n",
       " places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after\n",
       " the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where\n",
       " Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end,\n",
       " which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\n",
       " round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and,\n",
       " finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\n",
       " mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood\n",
       " showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the\n",
       " other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to\n",
       " that clue.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\n",
       " and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\n",
       " someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the\n",
       " wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\n",
       " an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window;\n",
       " someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\n",
       " pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet,\n",
       " their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.\n",
       " He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\n",
       " opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was\n",
       " it brought him the coronet?\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\n",
       " whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\n",
       " was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the\n",
       " maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be\n",
       " accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\n",
       " cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her\n",
       " secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered\n",
       " that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\n",
       " coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\n",

       " that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited\n",
       " one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being\n",
       " a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\n",

       " first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\n",
       " had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\n",
       " glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I\n",
       " put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see\n",
       " all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\n",
       " nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,\n",
       " I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small\n",
       " bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road\n",
       " is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,\n",
       " was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking\n",
       " earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find\n",
       " her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\n",
       " convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\n",

       " can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so\n",
       " that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and\n",
       " God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out\n",
       " of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\n",
       " moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\n",
       " almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\n",
       " scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the\n",
       " copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a\n",
       " giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,\n",
       " and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into\n",
       " the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\n",
       " know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\n",
       " bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\n",
       " myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little\n",
       " things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\n",
       " and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and\n",
       " as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use\n",
       " of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\n",
       " oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first\n",
       " key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing\n",
       " in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of\n",
       " hair.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the\n",
       " same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon\n",
       " me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\n",
       " undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\n",
       " I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\n",
       " it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it\n",
       " meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the\n",
       " matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening\n",
       " a drawer which they had locked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\n",
       " soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,\n",
       " however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that\n",
       " which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\n",
       " invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\n",
       " Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his\n",
       " face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I\n",
       " was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\n",
       " the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\n",
       " past me without a word or a look.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\n",
       " with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows\n",
       " of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which\n",
       " were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all\n",
       " deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\n",
       " Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I\n",

       " matters.’\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I,\n",
       " ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them\n",
       " has the shutters up.’\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I\n",

       " have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed\n",
       " it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he\n",
       " looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\n",
       " something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire\n",
       " to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It\n",
       " was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my\n",
       " penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was\n",
       " woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\n",
       " and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides\n",
       " Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\n",
       " rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the\n",
       " door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very\n",
       " drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt\n",
       " at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,\n",
       " and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\n",
       " the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\n",
       " which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three\n",
       " doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\n",
       " empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the\n",
       " other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\n",
       " The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one\n",
       " of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,\n",
       " and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well,\n",
       " and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\n",
       " shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it\n",
       " that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in\n",
       " light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and\n",
       " wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within\n",
       " the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of\n",
       " dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose\n",
       " up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and\n",
       " I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\n",
       " clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the\n",
       " door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I\n",

       " into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must\n",

       " lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could\n",
       " not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of\n",
       " the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all\n",
       " horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I\n",
       " might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my\n",
       " fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and\n",
       " cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and\n",
       " then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as\n",
       " I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller\n",
       " had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that\n",
       " he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage\n",
       " creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay\n",
       " awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no\n",
       " difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be\n",
       " back before three o’clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a\n",

       " and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\n",
       " the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the\n",
       " news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\n",

       " “I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d\n",
       " have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If\n",
       " there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that\n",
       " her father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but\n",
       " it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\n",
       " friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her\n",
       " own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a\n",
       " word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew\n",
       " he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\n",
       " who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it\n",
       " time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\n",
       " married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\n",
       " on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at\n",
       " death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with\n",
       " her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young\n",
       " man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good\n",
       " enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\n",
       " remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\n",
       " imprisonment?”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “Yes, sir.”\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “That was it, sir.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\n",
       " blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\n",
       " metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as\n",
       " his.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said\n",
       " Mrs. Toller serenely.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\n",

       " gone out.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes,\n",
       " “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here\n",
       " comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\n",
       " best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our <i>locus\n",
       " standi</i> now is rather a questionable one.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches\n",
       " in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept\n",
       " alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their\n",
       " old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he\n",
       " finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\n",
       " married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he\n",
       " is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to\n",
       " Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested\n",
       " no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of\n",
       " his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I\n",

       " name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\n",
       " not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\n",
       " that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\n",
       " balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\n",
       " machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\n",
       " a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\n",
       " sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\n",
       " the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\n",
       " admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\n",
       " to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\n",
       " results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\n",
       " high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\n",
       " nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\n",
       " the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",

       " sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\n",
       " society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\n",
       " buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\n",
       " and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
       " nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\n",
       " occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\n",
       " following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\n",
       " abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\n",
       " vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\n",
       " Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\n",
       " brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\n",

       " from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\n",
       " way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\n",
       " must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\n",
       " incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\n",
       " Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\n",
       " rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\n",
       " figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\n",
       " room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\n",
       " behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\n",
       " told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\n",
       " drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\n",
       " bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\n",
       " me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\n",
       " armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\n",
       " gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\n",
       " singular introspective fashion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you\n",
       " have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Seven!” I answered.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
       " fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\n",
       " intended to go into harness.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then, how do you know?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\n",
       " very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant\n",
       " girl?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would\n",
       " certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that\n",
       " I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
       " have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
       " Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,\n",
       " I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on\n",
       " the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather\n",
       " is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
       " someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to\n",
       " remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\n",
       " been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant\n",
       " boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\n",
       " gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of\n",
       " nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of\n",
       " his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,\n",
       " indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical\n",
       " profession.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\n",
       " deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
       " “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\n",
       " easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am\n",
       " baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as\n",
       " good as yours.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
       " down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction\n",
       " is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from\n",
       " the hall to this room.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Frequently.”\n",

       " “Then how many are there?”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\n",
       " point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and\n",
       " observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and\n",
       " since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,\n",
       " you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\n",
       " pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\n",
       " by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",

       " “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\n",
       " o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you\n",
       " upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the\n",
       " royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted\n",
       " with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\n",
       " account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at\n",
       " that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine\n",
       " that it means?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
       " data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
       " theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
       " endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could\n",
       " not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
       " stiff.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is\n",
       " not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a\n",
       " “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven\n",
       " into the texture of the paper.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands\n",
       " for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\n",
       " It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\n",
       " course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
       " glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
       " from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
       " German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\n",
       " ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its\n",
       " numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\n",
       " make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant\n",
       " cloud from his cigarette.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
       " peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have\n",
       " from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have\n",
       " written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
       " remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon\n",
       " Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he\n",
       " comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels\n",
       " against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued,\n",
       " glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of\n",

       " Watson, if there is nothing else.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit\n",
       " down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage,\n",
       " paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative\n",
       " tap.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in\n",
       " height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a\n",
       " richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy\n",
       " bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his\n",
       " double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his\n",
       " shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a\n",
       " brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway\n",
       " up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\n",
       " completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\n",
       " appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across\n",
       " the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
       " mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\n",
       " raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a\n",
       " man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin\n",
       " suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
       " marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked\n",
       " from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and\n",

       " Whom have I the honour to address?”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my\n",

       " this gentleman anything which you may say to me.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said\n",
       " he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\n",
       " that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to\n",

       " not exactly my own.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be\n",
       " taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously\n",
       " compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter\n",
       " implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure\n",
       " of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner\n",
       " and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked\n",
       " impatiently at his gigantic client.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked,\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable\n",
       " agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face\n",
       " and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I\n",
       " am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken\n",
       " before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\n",
       " Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down\n",
       " once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\n",
       " understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.\n",
       " Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without\n",
       " putting myself in his power. I have come <i>incognito</i> from Prague for the\n",
       " purpose of consulting you.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\n",
       " opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all\n",
       " paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a\n",
       " subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this\n",

       " replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\n",
       " her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated\n",
       " whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come\n",

       " “what do you make of it all?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I make nothing of it,” I answered frankly. “It is a most\n",
       " mysterious business.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the\n",
       " less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\n",
       " which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three pipe problem,\n",
       " and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled\n",
       " himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose,\n",
       " and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\n",
       " like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had\n",
       " dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of\n",
       " his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe\n",

       " music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or\n",
       " French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!”\n",

       " We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us\n",
       " to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to\n",
       " in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines\n",
       " of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,\n",
       " where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard\n",
       " fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a\n",
       " brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner\n",

       " Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\n",
       " all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked\n",
       " slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly\n",
       " at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s, and, having\n",
       " thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went\n",
       " up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\n",
       " clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the\n",
       " retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of\n",
       " a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the\n",
       " traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the\n",
       " immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while\n",
       " the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was\n",
       " difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately\n",

       " “Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing\n",

       " of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane’s\n",
       " carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,\n",
       " Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had some play. A\n",
       " sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is\n",

       " fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid,\n",
       " dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the\n",
       " relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to\n",
       " conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted\n",
       " itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\n",
       " thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\n",
       " occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme\n",
       " languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly\n",
       " formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid\n",
       " his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of\n",
       " the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power\n",
       " would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with\n",
       " his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that\n",
       " of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at\n",

       " hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a\n",
       " formidable man—a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it\n",
       " out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should\n",

       " above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two\n",
       " men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while\n",
       " the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and\n",

       " <p>\n",

       " but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that\n",

       " will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £\n",

       " have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal\n",
       " London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will\n",

       " is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\n",
       " napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much\n",

       " <i>Encyclopædia</i>, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the\n",
       " way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\n",
       " really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt\n",
       " suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his\n",
       " accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and\n",

       " elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\n",
       " be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the\n",
       " assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\n",
       " cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\n",
       " inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one\n",

       " His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\n",

       " only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the\n",

       " When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\n",
       " the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\n",

       " a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\n",

       " rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The man married a woman very much older than himself for her\n",
       " money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\n",
       " daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\n",
       " in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\n",
       " was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\n",
       " disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\n",
       " evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\n",
       " would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\n",
       " course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\n",
       " it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\n",
       " seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\n",
       " not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\n",
       " announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\n",
       " clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\n",
       " than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\n",
       " himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\n",
       " moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\n",
       " insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\n",
       " sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\n",
       " love himself.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never\n",
       " thought that she would have been so carried away.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly\n",
       " carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\n",
       " France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\n",
       " was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\n",
       " by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\n",
       " for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",
       " real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\n",
       " would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\n",
       " else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\n",
       " to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\n",
       " business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\n",
       " impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\n",
       " any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\n",
       " upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\n",
       " happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\n",
       " Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\n",
       " that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\n",
       " As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\n",
       " he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\n",
       " four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr.\n",
       " Windibank!”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been\n",
       " talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if\n",
       " you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who\n",
       " are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the\n",
       " first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an\n",
       " action for assault and illegal constraint.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and\n",
       " throwing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\n",
       " punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a\n",
       " whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing up at the\n",
       " sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not part of\n",
       " my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I think I\n",
       " shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the whip,\n",
       " but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,\n",
       " the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as\n",
       " he threw himself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise\n",
       " from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\n",
       " The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel\n",

       " that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see,\n",
       " was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\n",
       " that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\n",
       " the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\n",
       " as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\n",
       " action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\n",
       " handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest\n",

       " medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\n",
       " which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\n",
       " deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\n",

       " blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\n",

       " which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\n",
       " It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\n",
       " many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\n",
       " either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\n",
       " made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\n",
       " the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\n",
       " interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was\n",
       " directed towards a definite end.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\n",
       " across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\n",
       " park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\n",
       " side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\n",
       " landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\n",
       " very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\n",
       " between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\n",
       " showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\n",
       " moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\n",
       " by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\n",
       " and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\n",
       " grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\n",
       " my companion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\n",
       " other trace. But how on earth—”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
       " twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\n",
       " the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\n",
       " came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\n",
       " with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\n",
       " feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\n",
       " feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\n",
       " better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\n",
       " are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\n",
       " so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\n",
       " out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\n",
       " father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\n",
       " butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\n",
       " here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
       " they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\n",
       " from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\n",
       " until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\n",
       " beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\n",
       " farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\n",
       " satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\n",
       " dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\n",
       " examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\n",
       " far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\n",
       " he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\n",
       " until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\n",
       " returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\n",
       " right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\n",
       " and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",
       " luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out.\n",

       " “The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There\n",
       " was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the\n",
       " injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\n",

       " to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I\n",

       " have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be\n",
       " entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I\n",
       " struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and\n",

       " high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\n",
       " too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings\n",
       " without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have\n",
       " their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that\n",
       " absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of\n",

       " may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\n",
       " watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore\n",
       " the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of\n",
       " the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at\n",
       " some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the\n",

       " As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and\n",

       " deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\n",

       " lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to\n",

       " at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw\n",

       " of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under Hood, where\n",
       " he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his\n",
       " plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he\n",
       " came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had\n",
       " made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them\n",
       " was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in\n",
       " extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\n",
       " quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\n",
       " disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he\n",
       " set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house,\n",
       " and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he\n",

       " year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my\n",
       " father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he\n",
       " was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he\n",
       " would make me his representative both with the servants and with the\n",

       " upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips\n",
       " at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\n",
       " skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in\n",
       " his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and then, ‘My\n",

       " lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in\n",
       " England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something, so we\n",
       " may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something\n",
       " which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce\n",

       " formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil\n",
       " War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country,\n",
       " notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power\n",
       " was used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro\n",
       " voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed\n",

       " oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\n",

       " We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she know where\n",
       " her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when\n",
       " the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City.\n",
       " Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back,\n",
       " twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him\n",
       " eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the\n",
       " docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be\n",
       " found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what\n",
       " was she to do? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\n",
       " place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not\n",
       " escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at\n",
       " all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and as such I had influence\n",
       " over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word\n",
       " that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the\n",
       " address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair\n",
       " and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\n",
       " strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could\n",

       " north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a\n",
       " gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap\n",
       " like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my\n",
       " cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the\n",
       " ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp\n",
       " above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick\n",
       " and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange\n",

       " pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the\n",
       " newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light,\n",
       " now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the\n",
       " metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others\n",
       " talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming\n",
       " in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his\n",
       " own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the\n",
       " farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\n",
       " three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting\n",

       " anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular\n",

       " do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700 a\n",
       " year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\n",
       " advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which\n",
       " improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All\n",
       " day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very\n",

       " rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from\n",
       " coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not\n",
       " ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on\n",
       " my pigments and wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a\n",
       " disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room,\n",
       " and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my\n",
       " violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that\n",
       " morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had\n",
       " just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I\n",
       " hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other\n",
       " clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables\n",
       " up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief,\n",

       " for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off\n",
       " my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was\n",

       " right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at\n",

       " very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\n",
       " in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\n",

       " miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every\n",

       " returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down\n",
       " Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man,\n",
       " walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his\n",
       " shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between\n",
       " this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the\n",
       " man’s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging\n",
       " it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed\n",

       " having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform\n",
       " rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid\n",
       " the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road.\n",
       " The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in\n",
       " possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the\n",
       " shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\n",

       " B.’ are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some\n",
       " thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it\n",

       " for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.\n",
       " There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials\n",
       " “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for\n",
       " a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked,\n",
       " exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was\n",

       " been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences which are\n",
       " very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of\n",
       " probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the\n",
       " face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years,\n",
       " although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now\n",
       " than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the\n",
       " decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,\n",

       " sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\n",
       " has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he\n",
       " anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be\n",
       " deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in\n",
       " then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and\n",
       " the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three\n",
       " years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the\n",
       " world.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\n",
       " the moral retrogression?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he putting\n",
       " his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. “They are\n",
       " never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\n",
       " of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the\n",
       " wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to\n",
       " replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which\n",
       " is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has\n",
       " endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with\n",
       " ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\n",
       " that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be\n",
       " gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The lens\n",
       " discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber.\n",
       " They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream.\n",
       " This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the\n",
       " fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most\n",

       " rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle,\n",
       " such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a\n",

       " I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\n",
       " to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible\n",
       " pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had\n",
       " not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice\n",
       " which I shall never forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The\n",
       " speckled band!’ There was something else which she would fain have said,\n",
       " and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the\n",
       " Doctor’s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I\n",
       " rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his\n",
       " room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was\n",
       " unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical\n",
       " aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I thought it as well,” said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\n",
       " “that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\n",
       " definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\n",
       " that we have been as good as our word.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which\n",

       " “We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion\n",
       " and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\n",
       " one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards,\n",
       " while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was\n",
       " in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and\n",
       " the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys,\n",
       " showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been\n",
       " erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\n",
       " there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked\n",
       " slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\n",

       " “Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs\n",

       " course?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\n",

       " your shutters?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open\n",
       " window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without\n",
       " success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the\n",
       " bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron,\n",
       " built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!” said he, scratching\n",
       " his chin in some perplexity, “my theory certainly presents some\n",
       " difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three\n",
       " bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at\n",
       " once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which\n",
       " her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low\n",
       " ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\n",
       " brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in\n",
       " another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These\n",
       " articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\n",
       " room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and the\n",
       " panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured\n",
       " that it may have dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one\n",
       " of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and\n",
       " round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked at last pointing\n",
       " to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying\n",
       " upon the pillow.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It goes to the housekeeper’s room.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “It looks newer than the other things?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted\n",
       " for ourselves.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will\n",
       " excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He\n",
       " threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly\n",
       " backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he\n",
       " did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\n",
       " walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his\n",
       " eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it\n",
       " a brisk tug.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can\n",

       " the ventilator is.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There\n",
       " are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\n",
       " builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same\n",
       " trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\n",
       " time.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\n",
       " bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss\n",
       " Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter,\n",

       " mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden\n",
       " chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\n",
       " things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all\n",
       " of them with the keenest interest.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer\n",
       " of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one\n",

       " Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles\n",
       " protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\n",
       " Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed\n",
       " during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a\n",
       " dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a\n",
       " peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\n",

       " puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in\n",

       " happened.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\n",
       " throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\n",
       " perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\n",

       " Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\n",
       " It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to\n",
       " too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl,\n",
       " how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at\n",
       " Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that\n",
       " the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The\n",
       " little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion\n",
       " which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\n",
       " insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n",
       " ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\n",
       " appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match,\n",
       " were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the\n",
       " merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear\n",
       " to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come\n",
       " either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\n",
       " already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung\n",
       " down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was\n",
       " clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\n",
       " there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\n",
       " The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my\n",
       " knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India,\n",
       " I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\n",
       " poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just\n",
       " such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern\n",
       " training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also,\n",
       " from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner,\n",
       " indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show\n",
       " where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\n",
       " course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the\n",
       " victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to\n",
       " return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the\n",
       " hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope\n",
       " and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might\n",
       " escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\n",
       " inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on\n",
       " it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the\n",
       " ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord\n",
       " were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\n",
       " clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily\n",
       " closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my\n",
       " mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.\n",
       " I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly\n",

       " that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it must have been\n",
       " nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more\n",
       " than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me with great\n",
       " intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the\n",
       " world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows\n",
       " to see something of where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I\n",
       " could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\n",
       " and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but the\n",
       " colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon flagged. At\n",
       " last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness\n",
       " of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark\n",
       " sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which\n",
       " gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and\n",
       " into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front\n",
       " of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\n",
       " heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\n",
       " drove away.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\n",
       " looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\n",
       " the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light shot out in our\n",
       " direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\n",
       " she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. I could\n",
       " see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her\n",
       " dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a\n",
       " foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion\n",
       " answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly\n",
       " fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her\n",
       " ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\n",
       " walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for\n",
       " a few minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet,\n",
       " little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\n",
       " several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the\n",
       " top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you waiting an\n",
       " instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\n",
       " German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the others being\n",
       " volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window, hoping that I might\n",
       " catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was\n",
       " folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock\n",
       " ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\n",
       " still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these\n",
       " German people, and what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\n",
       " place? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all\n",
       " I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\n",
       " Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so the place\n",
       " might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the\n",
       " absolute stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,\n",
       " humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was\n",
       " thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\n",
       " stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the\n",
       " aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp\n",
       " beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was\n",
       " sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one\n",
       " shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of\n",
       " broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse,\n",
       " into the gloom behind her.\n",

       " made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of\n",
       " Heaven!’ she whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too\n",

       " before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having\n",
       " carried out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This woman\n",
       " might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though\n",

       " this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which\n",
       " receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is\n",
       " familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness\n",

       " knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said\n",

       " We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had\n",
       " covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But\n",
       " now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right\n",
       " enough.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall\n",
       " into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic\n",
       " column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the\n",
       " neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Whose house is it?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Dr. Becher’s.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German,\n",
       " very thin, with a long, sharp nose?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\n",
       " Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\n",
       " waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I understand,\n",
       " who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do\n",
       " him no harm.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in\n",
       " the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great\n",
       " widespread whitewashed building in front of us, spouting fire at every chink\n",
       " and window, while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly\n",
       " striving to keep the flames under.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.\n",
       " “There is the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.\n",
       " That second window is the one that I jumped from.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge\n",
       " upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it\n",
       " was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt they\n",
       " were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now keep\n",
       " your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much\n",
       " fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " And Holmes’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word\n",
       " has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the\n",
       " morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing\n",
       " several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of\n",
       " Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even\n",
       " Holmes’ ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their\n",
       " whereabouts.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had\n",
       " found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon\n",
       " a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at\n",
       " last successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had\n",
       " fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save\n",
       " some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery\n",
       " which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel\n",
       " and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be\n",
       " found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\n",
       " been already referred to.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where\n",
       " he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for\n",
       " the soft mould, which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried\n",
       " down by two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other\n",
       " unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the silent\n",
       " Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted\n",
       " the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well,” said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return\n",
       " once more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost\n",
       " my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of\n",

       " fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile,\n",
       " too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I\n",
       " promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry\n",

       " As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he\n",
       " slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a\n",

       " claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of\n",
       " that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became\n",
       " absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover\n",

       " course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it to know that\n",

       " <p>\n",

       " any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in\n",
       " the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of\n",

       " possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor\n",
       " would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.\n",
       " This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the\n",

       " in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at\n",
       " present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think\n",
       " necessary. I have already offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do!\n",

       " returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to\n",

       " story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the banker’s\n",
       " son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still\n",
       " I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some\n",
       " grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.\n",
       " He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with\n",
       " his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\n",
       " thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\n",
       " hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat\n",
       " with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk\n",
       " brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little\n",
       " from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down\n",
       " in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance. On the right side\n",
       " was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat\n",
       " hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the\n",
       " tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables,\n",
       " and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little\n",
       " used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all\n",
       " round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so\n",
       " round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder\n",
       " and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.\n",
       " We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\n",
       " She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which\n",
       " seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that\n",
       " I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face. Her lips, too,\n",
       " were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently\n",
       " into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker\n",
       " had done in the morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was\n",
       " evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for\n",
       " self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and\n",
       " passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\n",
       " dad?” she asked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\n",

       " having acted so harshly.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\n",
       " him.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\n",
       " coronet in his hand?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word\n",
       " for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so\n",
       " dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary!\n",
       " Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\n",
       " from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London to\n",
       " inquire more deeply into it.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he\n",
       " hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\n",

       " look at it.” He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\n",
       " upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art, and\n",
       " the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the\n",

       " his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the\n",
       " love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have\n",
       " been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\n",

       " slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of\n",
       " this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\n",
       " light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in\n",
       " her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along\n",
       " and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed\n",
       " in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the\n",
       " coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to\n",
       " her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\n",

       " he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and how\n",
       " all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his\n",
       " bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,\n",
       " where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to\n",
       " get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your\n",
       " lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the\n",
       " scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something\n",
       " suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands,\n",
       " rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed\n",
       " that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to\n",
       " straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\n",

       " that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state\n",
       " of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough\n",
       " consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and\n",
       " preserved her secret.”\n",

       " wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\n",
       " cruelly I have misjudged him!”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once\n",
       " went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\n",
       " which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening before, and\n",
       " also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along\n",
       " the tradesmen’s path, but found it all trampled down and\n",
       " indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen\n",
       " door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one\n",
       " side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been\n",
       " disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the\n",
       " deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then\n",
       " had gone away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her\n",
       " sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\n",
       " I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,\n",
       " which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long\n",
       " and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\n",
       " line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once\n",
       " convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son. The first had\n",
       " walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\n",
       " places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after\n",
       " the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where\n",
       " Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end,\n",
       " which was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\n",
       " round, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and,\n",
       " finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\n",
       " mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood\n",
       " showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the high road at the\n",
       " other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to\n",
       " that clue.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\n",
       " and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that\n",
       " someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep where the\n",
       " wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\n",
       " an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the window;\n",
       " someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had\n",
       " pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet,\n",
       " their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected.\n",
       " He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\n",
       " opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man, and who was\n",
       " it brought him the coronet?\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\n",
       " whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\n",
       " was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the\n",
       " maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be\n",
       " accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his\n",
       " cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her\n",
       " secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered\n",
       " that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\n",
       " coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who\n",
       " else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew\n",
       " that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very limited\n",
       " one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being\n",
       " a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots\n",
       " and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered\n",
       " him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say\n",

       " that it was time to commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\n",
       " similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\n",
       " again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an\n",
       " immense <i>répertoire</i>, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a\n",
       " yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow\n",
       " might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for\n",
       " about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in\n",
       " the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n",

       " became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At\n",
       " first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror\n",
       " had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\n",
       " glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I\n",
       " put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see\n",
       " all that there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\n",
       " nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,\n",
       " I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small\n",
       " bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my direction. The road\n",
       " is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, however,\n",
       " was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking\n",
       " earnestly up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find\n",
       " her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am\n",
       " convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\n",

       " can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so\n",
       " that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and\n",
       " God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake\n",

       " “The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out\n",
       " of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a beautiful\n",
       " moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and\n",
       " almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the\n",
       " scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the\n",
       " copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a\n",
       " giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle,\n",
       " and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into\n",
       " the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\n",
       " know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the\n",
       " bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse\n",
       " myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little\n",
       " things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty\n",
       " and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and\n",
       " as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use\n",
       " of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\n",
       " oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first\n",
       " key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing\n",
       " in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of\n",
       " hair.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the\n",
       " same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon\n",
       " me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I\n",
       " undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\n",
       " I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was\n",
       " it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it\n",
       " meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the\n",
       " matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening\n",
       " a drawer which they had locked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\n",
       " soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing,\n",
       " however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that\n",
       " which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\n",
       " invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr.\n",
       " Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his\n",
       " face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I\n",
       " was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\n",
       " the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\n",
       " past me without a word or a look.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds\n",
       " with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows\n",
       " of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which\n",
       " were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all\n",
       " deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr.\n",
       " Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I\n",

       " matters.’\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I,\n",
       " ‘you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them\n",
       " has the shutters up.’\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I\n",
       " have made my dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we\n",
       " have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed\n",
       " it?’ He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he\n",
       " looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\n",
       " something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire\n",
       " to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of that. It\n",
       " was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my\n",
       " penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s instinct; perhaps it was\n",
       " woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,\n",
       " and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides\n",
       " Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted\n",
       " rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the\n",
       " door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very\n",
       " drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt\n",
       " at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs,\n",
       " and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned\n",
       " the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\n",
       " which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three\n",
       " doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each led into an\n",
       " empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the\n",
       " other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them.\n",
       " The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one\n",
       " of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall,\n",
       " and fastened at the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well,\n",
       " and the key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\n",
       " shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it\n",
       " that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in\n",
       " light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and\n",
       " wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within\n",
       " the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of\n",
       " dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose\n",
       " up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and\n",
       " I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\n",
       " clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the\n",
       " door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I\n",

       " over that threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened\n",
       " into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a\n",
       " demon—‘I’ll throw you to the mastiff.’\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could\n",
       " not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of\n",
       " the man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all\n",
       " horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of course I\n",
       " might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my\n",
       " fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and\n",
       " cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and\n",
       " then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as\n",
       " I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller\n",

       " he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage\n",
       " creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay\n",
       " awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no\n",

       " up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still\n",

       " “I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d\n",
       " have done so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If\n",
       " there’s police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that\n",

       " it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler at a\n",
       " friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her\n",
       " own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a\n",
       " word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew\n",
       " he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward,\n",
       " who would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it\n",
       " time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she\n",
       " married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept\n",
       " on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at\n",
       " death’s door. Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with\n",
       " her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young\n",
       " man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good\n",
       " enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\n",
       " remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\n",
       " imprisonment?”\n",

       " <p>\n",

       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\n",
       " blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\n",
       " metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as\n",
       " his.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said\n",
       " Mrs. Toller serenely.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\n",

       " gone out.”\n",
       " </p>\n",

       " “You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes,\n",
       " “for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here\n",
       " comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches\n",
       " in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept\n",
       " alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live with their\n",
       " old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle’s past life that he\n",
       " finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were\n",
       " married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he\n",
       " is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to\n",
       " Miss Violet Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested\n",
       " no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of\n",
       " his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I\n",

       " is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\n",
       " name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\n",
       " not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\n",
       " that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\n",
       " balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\n",
       " machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\n",
       " a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\n",
       " sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\n",
       " the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\n",
       " admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\n",
       " to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\n",
       " results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\n",
       " high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\n",
       " nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\n",
       " the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\n",
       " other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\n",
       " around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\n",
       " sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\n",
       " society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\n",
       " buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\n",
       " and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
       " nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\n",
       " occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\n",
       " following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\n",
       " abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\n",
       " vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\n",
       " Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\n",
       " brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\n",
       " so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\n",
       " signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
       " the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning\n",
       " from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\n",
       " way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\n",
       " must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\n",
       " incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\n",
       " Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\n",
       " rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\n",
       " figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\n",
       " room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\n",
       " behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\n",
       " told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\n",
       " drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\n",
       " bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\n",
       " me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\n",
       " armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\n",
       " gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\n",
       " singular introspective fashion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you\n",
       " have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Seven!” I answered.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
       " fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you\n",
       " intended to go into harness.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then, how do you know?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself\n",
       " very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant\n",
       " girl?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would\n",
       " certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that\n",
       " I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
       " have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
       " Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again,\n",
       " I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on\n",
       " the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather\n",
       " is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
       " someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to\n",
       " remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had\n",
       " been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant\n",
       " boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a\n",
       " gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of\n",
       " nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of\n",
       " his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,\n",
       " indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical\n",
       " profession.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of\n",
       " deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
       " “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\n",
       " easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am\n",
       " baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as\n",
       " good as yours.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
       " down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction\n",
       " is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from\n",
       " the hall to this room.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Frequently.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How often?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Well, some hundreds of times.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Then how many are there?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “How many? I don’t know.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my\n",
       " point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and\n",
       " observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and\n",
       " since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences,\n",
       " you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,\n",
       " pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came\n",
       " by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight\n",
       " o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you\n",
       " upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the\n",
       " royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted\n",
       " with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This\n",
       " account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at\n",
       " that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine\n",
       " that it means?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
       " data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
       " theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
       " endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could\n",
       " not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
       " stiff.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is\n",
       " not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a\n",
       " “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven\n",
       " into the texture of the paper.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands\n",
       " for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’\n",
       " It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of\n",
       " course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
       " glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
       " from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
       " German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.\n",
       " ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its\n",
       " numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you\n",
       " make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant\n",
       " cloud from his cigarette.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
       " peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have\n",
       " from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have\n",

       " up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,\n",
       " completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole\n",

       " the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
       " mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still\n",

       " his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of\n",
       " peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have\n",
       " equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression,\n",
       " his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.\n",

       " front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was\n",
       " just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct\n",
       " description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On\n",
       " the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\n",
       " animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a\n",
       " corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with\n",
       " a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down\n",

       " double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its\n",
       " being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of\n",
       " his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?”\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\n",
       " size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\n",
       " that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of\n",
       " the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry\n",
       " it about with her.”\n",

       " inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do\n",
       " their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could\n",
       " trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\n",
       " influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that\n",
       " she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\n",

       " loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out,\n",
       " which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the\n",

       " the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the\n",

       " replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen\n",

       " We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in\n",
       " the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr.\n",
       " Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he\n",
       " opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive\n",
       " iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps,\n",
       " which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light\n",
       " a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so,\n",
       " after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all\n",

       " “Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon\n",
       " the flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite\n",
       " hollow!” he remarked, looking up in surprise.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said Holmes\n",

       " of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured\n",
       " expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and,\n",
       " with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks\n",
       " between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his\n",
       " feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they\n",
       " can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they\n",
       " will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they\n",
       " will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no doubt you\n",
       " have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal\n",
       " London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will\n",
       " explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London\n",
       " should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.”\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had\n",
       " several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Your French gold?”\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\n",
       " borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\n",
       " become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it\n",
       " is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000\n",
       " napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much\n",
       " larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the\n",
       " directors have had misgivings upon the subject.”\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now\n",
       " it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour\n",
       " matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the\n",
       " screen over that dark lantern.”\n",
       " </p>,\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\n",
       " thought that, as we were a <i>partie carrée</i>, you might have your rubber\n",
       " after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far that\n",
       " we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our\n",
       " positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a\n",
       " disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand\n",
       " behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I\n",

       " crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in\n",
       " pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never before\n",
       " experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was\n",
       " still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To me, with my\n",
       " nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and\n",
       " subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back\n",

       " dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to\n",
       " change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of\n",
       " tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle\n",
       " breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier\n",
       " in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.\n",
       " From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.\n",
       " Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened\n",
       " out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a\n",
       " gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which\n",
       " felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the\n",
       " hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was\n",
       " withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single\n",
       " lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound,\n",
       " one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square,\n",
       " gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there\n",
       " peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a\n",
       " hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,\n",
       " until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of\n",
       " the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself,\n",
       " with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",

       " Holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and the pistol\n",

       " fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the\n",
       " <i>Encyclopædia</i>, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the\n",
       " way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,\n",
       " really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt\n",
       " suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his\n",
       " accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and\n",
       " what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the\n",
       " advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the\n",
       " man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every\n",
       " morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come\n",

       " a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such\n",
       " elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\n",
       " be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the\n",
       " assistant’s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the\n",
       " cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made\n",
       " inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one\n",
       " of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in\n",
       " the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\n",

       " cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the\n",
       " bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes,\n",
       " but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face.\n",
       " His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,\n",
       " wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The\n",
       " only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the\n",

       " and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I\n",

       " fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who\n",

       " When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and\n",
       " the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a\n",

       " money,” said he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the\n",
       " daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\n",
       " in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\n",
       " was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\n",
       " disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\n",
       " evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\n",
       " would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\n",
       " course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\n",
       " it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\n",
       " seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\n",
       " not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\n",
       " announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\n",
       " clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\n",
       " than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\n",
       " himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\n",
       " moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\n",
       " insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\n",

       " France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\n",
       " was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\n",
       " by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\n",
       " for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",
       " real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\n",
       " would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\n",
       " else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\n",
       " to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\n",

       " impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\n",

       " was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\n",
       " that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\n",
       " the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\n",
       " as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar\n",
       " action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\n",

       " little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in\n",
       " public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very\n",
       " excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily\n",
       " controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind\n",
       " you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not\n",

       " they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more\n",
       " worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note\n",
       " of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over\n",
       " of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’\n",
       " There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\n",
       " obvious.”\n",

       " “We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\n",

       " “And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.\n",
       " Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\n",
       " monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is\n",
       " a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four\n",
       " letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten.\n",
       " In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and the\n",
       " ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\n",

       " daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people\n",
       " in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It\n",
       " was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable\n",
       " disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was\n",
       " evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she\n",
       " would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of\n",
       " course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent\n",
       " it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\n",
       " seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would\n",
       " not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally\n",
       " announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her\n",
       " clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\n",
       " than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised\n",
       " himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a\n",
       " moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an\n",
       " insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl’s short\n",

       " France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She\n",
       " was flattered by the gentleman’s attentions, and the effect was increased\n",
       " by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call,\n",
       " for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\n",
       " real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which\n",
       " would finally secure the girl’s affections from turning towards anyone\n",
       " else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys\n",
       " to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the\n",
       " business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent\n",
       " impression upon the young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon\n",
       " any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted\n",
       " upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\n",
       " happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss\n",
       " Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate,\n",
       " that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man.\n",
       " As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther,\n",
       " he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a\n",

       " was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but\n",
       " that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were\n",
       " the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,\n",

       " by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\n",
       " might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun,\n",
       " which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these\n",

       " the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely\n",
       " to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young\n",
       " man’s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\n",
       " absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\n",
       " the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his\n",
       " screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What\n",
       " could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my\n",
       " medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\n",
       " which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\n",
       " deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\n",
       " the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a\n",
       " blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\n",
       " been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as\n",
       " when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go\n",
       " for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow\n",
       " fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes’ attention to it.\n",
       " Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It\n",
       " could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\n",
       " delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his\n",
       " fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible\n",
       " explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If\n",
       " that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\n",
       " presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\n",
       " return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his\n",
       " back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and\n",
       " improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s\n",
       " opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I\n",

       " steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\n",
       " compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\n",
       " nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind\n",
       " was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\n",
       " remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\n",
       " impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track\n",
       " which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\n",
       " It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\n",
       " many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\n",
       " either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\n",
       " made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\n",
       " the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\n",
       " interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was\n",
       " directed towards a definite end.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\n",
       " across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\n",
       " park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\n",
       " side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\n",
       " landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\n",
       " very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\n",
       " between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\n",
       " showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\n",
       " moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\n",
       " by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\n",
       " and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\n",
       " grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\n",
       " my companion.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
       " twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\n",
       " the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\n",
       " came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\n",
       " with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\n",
       " feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\n",
       " feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\n",
       " better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\n",
       " are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\n",
       " so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\n",
       " out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\n",
       " father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\n",
       " butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\n",
       " here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
       " they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\n",
       " from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\n",
       " until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\n",
       " beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\n",
       " farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\n",
       " satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\n",
       " dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\n",
       " examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\n",
       " far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\n",
       " he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\n",
       " until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n",
       " </p>\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\n",
       " returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\n",
       " right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\n",
       " and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",

       " medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\n",
       " which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s\n",
       " deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and\n",

       " blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have\n",

       " steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\n",
       " compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His\n",
       " nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind\n",
       " was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\n",
       " remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\n",
       " impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track\n",
       " which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool.\n",
       " It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of\n",
       " many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on\n",
       " either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he\n",
       " made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him,\n",
       " the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards\n",
       " across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private\n",
       " park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther\n",
       " side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\n",
       " landowner’s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew\n",
       " very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across\n",
       " between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade\n",
       " showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so\n",
       " moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left\n",
       " by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face\n",
       " and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled\n",
       " grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon\n",
       " my companion.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>\n",
       " “What did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\n",
       " twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among\n",
       " the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they\n",
       " came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party\n",
       " with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight\n",
       " feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same\n",
       " feet.” He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a\n",
       " better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. “These\n",
       " are young McCarthy’s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly,\n",
       " so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears\n",
       " out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\n",
       " father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\n",
       " butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we\n",
       " here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,\n",
       " they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come\n",
       " from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track\n",
       " until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great\n",
       " beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the\n",
       " farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of\n",
       " satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and\n",
       " dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\n",
       " examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as\n",
       " far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also\n",
       " he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood\n",
       " until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.\n",

       " <p>\n",
       " “It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked,\n",
       " returning to his natural manner. “I fancy that this grey house on the\n",
       " right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran,\n",
       " and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\n",

      "To Sherlock Holmes she\n",
      "is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other\n",
      "name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was\n",
      "not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and\n",
      "that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\n",
      "balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing\n",
      "machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in\n",
      "a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a\n",
      "sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing\n",
      "the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to\n",
      "admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was\n",
      "to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental\n",
      "results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own\n",
      "high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a\n",
      "nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was\n",
      "the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each\n",
      "other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up\n",
      "around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were\n",
      "sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of\n",
      "society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,\n",
      "buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine\n",
      "and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n",
      "nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and\n",
      "occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in\n",
      "following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been\n",
      "abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some\n",
      "vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the\n",
      "Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson\n",
      "brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished\n",
      "so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these\n",
      "signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n",
      "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning\n",
      "from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\n",
      "way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which\n",
      "must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\n",
      "incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see\n",
      "Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His\n",
      "rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare\n",
      "figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the\n",
      "room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\n",
      "behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner\n",
      "told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his\n",
      "drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\n",
      "bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see\n",
      "me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\n",
      "armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a\n",
      "gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his\n",
      "singular introspective fashion.\n",
